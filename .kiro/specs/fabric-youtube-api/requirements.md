# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a public REST API service that allows users to fetch
Fabric patterns and apply them to YouTube content through HTTP endpoints. The
service will be deployed on Railway with a custom public domain, making Fabric's
AI pattern capabilities accessible via web API calls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fetch available Fabric patterns via
REST API, so that I can integrate Fabric's AI capabilities into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a GET request to `/api/patterns` THEN the system SHALL return a
   JSON list of all available patterns
2. WHEN I send a GET request to `/api/patterns/{pattern_name}` THEN the system
   SHALL return the specific pattern details including description and usage
3. WHEN I request a non-existent pattern THEN the system SHALL return a 404
   error with appropriate message
4. WHEN the patterns are fetched THEN the system SHALL include pattern metadata
   such as name, description, and category

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply Fabric patterns to YouTube
videos via API, so that I can process YouTube content programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to `/api/youtube/process` with video URL and
   pattern name THEN the system SHALL fetch the YouTube transcript and apply the
   specified pattern
2. WHEN I provide a YouTube URL THEN the system SHALL extract video ID and fetch
   transcript data
3. WHEN I specify a pattern name THEN the system SHALL apply that pattern to the
   YouTube content
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return the AI-generated
   result in JSON format
5. WHEN an invalid YouTube URL is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 400
   error with validation message
6. WHEN YouTube transcript is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a 422
   error with appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure AI model settings via API,
so that I can customize the AI processing behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request with AI model parameters THEN the system SHALL
   accept temperature, top_p, and model selection
2. WHEN I specify streaming preference THEN the system SHALL support both
   streaming and non-streaming responses
3. WHEN I provide invalid model parameters THEN the system SHALL return
   validation errors
4. WHEN no model is specified THEN the system SHALL use default model
   configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to be deployed on
Railway with proper configuration, so that it's accessible via a public domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via Railway's
   infrastructure
2. WHEN a custom domain is configured THEN the API SHALL be reachable via the
   public domain
3. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL bind to the correct port for Railway
   deployment
4. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL use them for AI API
   keys and configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want proper error handling and rate
limiting, so that the service is reliable and protected from abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status
   codes and error messages
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with
   retry information
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate API keys or
   tokens
4. WHEN the service is overloaded THEN it SHALL gracefully handle requests and
   provide meaningful responses

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that
I can easily integrate with the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the API root THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger
   documentation
2. WHEN I view the documentation THEN it SHALL include all endpoints,
   parameters, and response formats
3. WHEN I need examples THEN the documentation SHALL provide sample requests and
   responses
4. WHEN I want to test endpoints THEN the documentation SHALL include
   interactive API testing capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want proper logging and monitoring, so
that I can maintain and debug the service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request details and
   response times
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with appropriate
   severity levels
3. WHEN the service health needs checking THEN it SHALL provide health check
   endpoints
4. WHEN monitoring metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL expose relevant
   performance metrics
