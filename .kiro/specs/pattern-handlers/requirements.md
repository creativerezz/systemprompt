# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create pattern handlers that integrate seamlessly with the existing Fabric core architecture. The pattern handlers will provide a standardized way to process, validate, and execute AI patterns within the Fabric framework, ensuring consistent behavior across all pattern types while maintaining the existing plugin-based architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Fabric developer, I want standardized pattern handlers, so that all patterns can be processed consistently through the core system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pattern is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate the pattern structure against defined schemas
2. WHEN a pattern handler is created THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing plugin registry in internal/core
3. WHEN a pattern is executed THEN the handler SHALL follow the established plugin interface patterns
4. IF a pattern is malformed THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages
5. WHEN multiple patterns are processed THEN each SHALL be handled through the same standardized interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Fabric user, I want pattern handlers to work with existing AI vendors, so that I can use any supported AI service with any pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pattern handler executes THEN it SHALL work with all existing AI vendor plugins (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
2. WHEN switching between AI vendors THEN the pattern execution SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN a pattern uses vendor-specific features THEN the handler SHALL gracefully handle unsupported operations
4. IF an AI vendor is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Fabric developer, I want pattern handlers to support the existing pattern directory structure, so that all 200+ existing patterns continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading patterns from data/patterns/ THEN the handler SHALL read both system.md and user.md files
2. WHEN a pattern directory contains only system.md THEN the handler SHALL process it correctly
3. WHEN pattern metadata is needed THEN the handler SHALL extract it from the pattern files
4. IF a pattern directory is missing required files THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
5. WHEN patterns are updated THEN the handlers SHALL reload them without requiring system restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Fabric user, I want pattern handlers to support streaming and non-streaming output, so that I can choose the appropriate output method for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming is enabled THEN the pattern handler SHALL provide real-time output
2. WHEN streaming is disabled THEN the handler SHALL return complete results
3. WHEN output format is specified THEN the handler SHALL format results accordingly
4. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to non-streaming mode
5. WHEN using clipboard output THEN the handler SHALL integrate with existing clipboard functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Fabric developer, I want pattern handlers to be extensible, so that new pattern types and processing methods can be added without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new pattern types are added THEN they SHALL integrate through the same handler interface
2. WHEN custom processing is needed THEN developers SHALL be able to extend base handler functionality
3. WHEN handler behavior needs modification THEN it SHALL be possible through configuration or plugins
4. IF breaking changes are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
5. WHEN testing handlers THEN they SHALL be mockable and testable in isolation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Fabric user, I want pattern handlers to integrate with session management, so that I can maintain context across multiple pattern executions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is active THEN pattern handlers SHALL preserve context between executions
2. WHEN session data is needed THEN handlers SHALL access it through the existing session interface
3. WHEN patterns modify session state THEN changes SHALL be persisted appropriately
4. IF session storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality
5. WHEN sessions expire THEN handlers SHALL clean up associated resources
