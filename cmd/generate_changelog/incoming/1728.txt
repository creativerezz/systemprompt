- Improve OAuth flow messaging and token refresh diagnostics with better error handling
- Update tests to capture debuglog output via SetOutput for better test coverage
- Convert Perplexity streaming errors to unified debug logging and emit file write notifications through debuglog
- Standardize extension registry warnings and announce large audio processing steps via centralized logger
