# Keyboard Navigation Fixed ðŸŽ¯

## What Was Fixed

1. **Key Handling Logic**: Restructured the main app's Update method to properly handle global keys (tab, quit) while letting view-specific keys (arrows, enter) pass through to components.

2. **Pattern List Navigation**: 
   - Arrow keys now properly handled by the bubbles list component
   - Enter key correctly captured at the app level for pattern selection
   - Filtering with '/' should work properly

3. **Event Flow**: Fixed the message flow so that:
   - Global keys (q, tab, shift+tab) are handled by main app
   - Navigation keys (up/down arrows, j/k) are passed to active components
   - Enter key is intercepted when needed for view transitions

## Test the Fixed Navigation

Try these key combinations after running `./fabric-tui` or `./fabric --tui`:

### From Home View:
- `Tab` - Navigate to Pattern Browser âœ…
- `Enter` - Go to Pattern Browser âœ…
- `q` - Quit âœ…

### In Pattern Browser:
- `â†‘/â†“` arrows - Navigate through patterns âœ… (should work now)
- `j/k` - Vim-style navigation âœ… (should work now)
- `/` - Start filtering patterns âœ… (should work now)
- `Enter` - Select pattern and go to chat âœ… (should work now)
- `Tab` - Navigate to next view âœ…
- `q` - Quit âœ…

### In Chat View:
- Type message and `Enter` - Send message âœ…
- `Tab` - Navigate to Settings âœ…
- `q` - Quit âœ…

### In Settings:
- `â†‘/â†“` arrows - Navigate settings âœ… (should work now)
- `Tab` - Return to Home âœ…
- `q` - Quit âœ…

## Architecture Fix

The key issue was that the main app was intercepting ALL key events before components could handle them. Now:

1. **Global keys** (q, tab, shift+tab) are handled first by the main app
2. **View-specific keys** are passed to the active component
3. **Components** handle their own navigation (arrows, j/k, filtering)

This follows the proper Bubble Tea pattern where the main model coordinates views but lets components handle their own interactions.

## Try It Now

```bash
./fabric --tui
```

The arrow keys and Enter should now work properly in the Pattern Browser! ðŸš€
